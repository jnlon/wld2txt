Ideas/Todo

Here are some cool feature ideas that I probably will never get around to
implementing:

(1) A proper commandline interface (multiple files, a file output flag...)
(2) User customizable tile to character mappings (perhaps a config file?)
(3) Coloured output
(4) Multi-character regions

For (4), I was thinking something like this:

Here is what a 4x3 region of either 'LiquidWater', 'LiquidHoney', or
'LiquidLava' currently looks like:

The tilde character is great for representing liquid, but how do we tell them
apart from one another? 

How about 'intermixed' characters, so they could look something like:

LiquidWater       LiquidHoney        LiquidLava

  ~w~w              ~h~h               ~l~l
  w~w~              h~h~               l~l~
  ~w~w              ~h~h               ~l~l


This technique of creating a sort of "texture" out of different kinds of
characters (TXTures?) might produce really awesome looking images. Even more so
if the ratio of every character were also configurable.
